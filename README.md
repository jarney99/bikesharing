# Bikesharing

## Overview
We were tasked with showing the checkout time for users, checkout time by genders, trips by weekday per hour, trips by gender, and user trips by gender. This is done to convince the investors that a program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. We will show the investors of the bike trip analysis. 

## Results

This shows our checkout time per users. We can see that the trip duration is usually under an hour, and lasts for about 40 minutes with peak use at around 15 minutes.

With this graph we can see the most popular times for people to rent bikes. For weekdays it is morning and afternoon, but for weekends it is generally the same the whole day.

This is a comparison between subscribers and customers. We can see that subscribers rent much more than customers. 

## Summary
Based on the graphs made during the project, we can see that men generally rent more than women. However men and women rent for the same amount of time. It is also clear that subscribers rent much more than customers. The goal should be to get more subscribers because according to this data that would mean more bikes rented out.
